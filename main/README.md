# Welcome to the WishList Project

This project is built using the Django Framework and is part of my journey to become a web developer. It serves as a showcase of my backend development skills.

## Project Description

The WishList Website is a dynamic platform designed to help users organize and manage their wishes. Whether it's creating wishlists for different occasions or keeping track of desired items, this website has you covered.

### Technologies Used

To build this project, I used the following technologies:

- Python
- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Features

### User Authentication

- **Registration**: Users can create new accounts by providing a username, email, and password (with password confirmation).
- **Password Reset**: Forgot your password? No worries, users can reset their passwords via email.
- **Sign In/Sign Out**: Secure login and logout functionality.

### Wishlist Management

- **Create Wishlists**: Users can create wishlists with unique names to categorize their wishes (e.g., "Birthday Wishlist").
- **Add Wishes**: Within each wishlist, users can add an unlimited number of wishes (e.g., "Mobile," "Balloon," "Laptop," etc.).
- **Update/Delete**: Users have the flexibility to update or delete wishlists and individual wishes. When a wishlist is deleted, all wishes inside it are removed as well.

### Social Interaction

- **Follow and Be Followed**: Users can follow other users, and in return, users can see the wishlists and wishes of those they follow.
- **Discover Wishes**: Get inspired by exploring the wishlists and wishes of other users.
